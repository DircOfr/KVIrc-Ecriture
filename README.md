# KVIrc-Ecriture

French and untranslated script for KVIrc - It allows you to choose a writing style.
 First you choose if you want to write with an automatic uppercase letter.
 Nicknames are not affected by this option.
 Then you may choose to have this first uppercase letter colored (random colors).
 And you may choose to write in bold ou underlined, and choose colors (writing color and background) if you like.

I just discovered KVIrc (lees than 1 month ago), and I don't really know how to build a clean addon.

 - Day.kvs contains the aliases.
 - OnTextInput.dfaut.kvs contains what has to be added in event OnTextInput.
 - Action.kvs build the action.

I'm very conscious of all the things I still have to learn about addons.
 But I thought this kind of options should be present in KVIrc, so I'm transmitting what I have done.
 Anyone's free to improve it, to do better in a cleaner way.
